UCLA STATS170 Winter 2023 (Final Overall Course Grade: A)

Course Title: Time Series Analysis

Topics: 
- Introduction to Time Series Database Management Systems, R treatment of dates, APIs, places to obtain time series data and time series data analysis competitions. 
- Descriptive analysis of time series data, and jargon of time series data analysis.   
- The classical multiple regression model and its application to forecasting.  
- Autoregressive and Moving Average Forecasting models and ARMA(p,q) models for one stationary time series at a time.  
- ARIMA(p,d,q) models for nonstationary time series and ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q) for seasonal time series.  
- Multivariate time series methods 
- Machine learning for time series  (This topic will be introduced throughout the whole course, as needed for each of the topics above and at increasing levels of complexity as more is learned).  


## Final Project
Forecasted price using ARIMA, VAR, Gradient Boosting, Prophet, etc. and assembled a 50+ page research paper. Pre-transformed, differenced, and decomposed the data extracted through Quandl API and assessed the ACF plots. This research article provides a thorough time series analysis and forecasting of the performance of three significant retail segments in the US, namely Electronics & Appliance Stores, Sporting Goods, Hobby, Musical Instrument and Book Stores, and Furniture and Home Furnishings Stores. The study utilized time series data and various statistical models to gain insights into the trends and patterns of retail sales for each segment.
