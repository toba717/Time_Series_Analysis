### Load libraries and API Key
library(Quandl)
library(dygraphs)
Quandl.api_key("uSPQnqK5PuPzTydvoB_R") 

### Load Datasets
retail_electronic = Quandl(code="FRED/RSEASN",type="ts", collapse="monthly", meta=TRUE)
# Do not include 2020 and 2021 years in our data
electronic = window(retail_electronic, end = c(2019, 12))
# > 200 observations & start: 1992 1

### Examine Data
retail_electronic # not too long so can view whole dataset
head(retail_electronic)
tail(retail_electronic)
class(retail_electronic)
str(retail_electronic)
start(retail_electronic)
end(retail_electronic)
frequency(retail_electronic)
length(retail_electronic)

### Creating a training and testing set
retails_electronic_train = window(electronic, start = start(electronic), end = c(2019,12), freq = 12)
retails_electronic_test = window(electronic, start = c(2019, 1), freq = 12)

### Call the raw training dependent variable y
y = retails_electronic_train

### We look at Time Plot
plot.ts(y, main = "Retail Sales for Electronics", ylab = "Retail Sales (in Millions of Dollars)")
### Seasonal Box Plot
boxplot(y ~ cycle(y), ylab = "Retail Sales (in Millions of Dollars)", xlab = "Month")


### To see if the time series has changing variance, get a hint through decomposition
plot(decompose(y))
plot(decompose(y, type = "mult"))


##### Step 1 is to pre-transform the data
log.ts = ts(log(y), frequency = 12, start(y))
sqr.ts = ts(sqrt(y), frequency = 12, start(y))
qrt.ts = ts((y)^0.25, frequency = 12, start(y))

### Compare data with pre-differenced and pre-transformed data
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot.ts(y, type = "l", main = "Time Series Plot of Retail Sales for Electronics")
plot.ts(log.ts, type = "l", main = "Time Series Plot of log(Retail Sales) for Electronics")
plot.ts(sqr.ts, type = "l", main = "Time Series Plot of sqrt(Retail Sales) for Electronics")
plot.ts(qrt.ts, type = "l", main = "Time Series Plot of qrt(Retail Sales) for Electronics")
dev.off()

### Log transformation performs the best, so we will call this y*
ystar = log.ts
